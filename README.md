# SwiftFix Website

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to transform the existing single-page website of SwiftFix into a multi-page site, providing a richer content experience and an improved user interface. The migration aims to better present SwiftFix's services, optimize navigation, and enhance the overall user experience.

## Key Features

- **Multi-page structure:** Dividing the content into multiple pages (Home, About, Contact, Services) with intuitive navigation.
- **Modern design:** Adhering to the brand's graphic charter and ensuring an exceptional user experience across all devices.
- **Performance optimization:** Keeping the website loading speed optimal.
- **Enhanced contact form:** Implementing an interactive contact form with additional fields to make it easier for visitors to submit inquiries.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript** (if applicable for added interactivity)
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

## User Stories

1. As a visitor, I want to easily navigate between different sections of the site so I can quickly find the information I need.
2. As a Front-end UI/UX developer, I need to integrate new pages such as Home, About, Contact, and Services to enhance the overall performance of the site.
3. (Bonus) As a UX designer, I need to create a low-fidelity wireframe of the SwiftFix website to visualize the basic structure, element layout, and overall navigation.

## Bonus and Recommendations

- **Analyze current performance:** Before starting the migration, analyze the current single-page website structure to identify areas for improvement.
- **W3C standards compliance:** Use W3C validators (HTML and CSS) to ensure that your code complies with web standards.
- **Accessibility testing:** Perform accessibility tests using automated tools like Axe or WAVE to detect common accessibility issues on your site.
- **Deployment on GitHub Pages:** Enable GitHub Pages and deploy the solution.

## Project Structure

The website will consist of the following pages:

- **Home:** A landing page with an overview of SwiftFix.
- **About:** A page describing SwiftFix's mission and vision.
- **Contact:** An interactive form for visitors to send inquiries.
- **Services:** A page detailing the services offered by SwiftFix.
